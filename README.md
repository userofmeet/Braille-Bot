# Braille-Bot
This repository contains Arduino codes and schematics for a Braille bot. The bot converts text to Braille to help teach blind people Braille script. It uses an Arduino microcontroller, servo motors, an LCD display, buttons, and a 10k potentiometer. You can teach all letters, symbols, and numbers in Braille. Text can also be converted to Braille using the serial monitor, with the conversion speed adjustable via the potentiometer. Future versions might include a speaker to spell out the text.
